## The Golden Rule: 

ü¶∏ ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è `Stop starting and start finishing.` üèÅ

If you work on more than one feature at a time, you are guaranteed to multiply your bugs and your anxiety.

## Making a plan

1) **Make a drawing of your app. Simple "wireframes"**
1) **Look at the drawing and name the HTML elements you'll need to realize your vision**
1) **Look at the drawing and imagine using the app. What _state_ do you need to track?**
1) **For each HTML element ask: Why do I need this? (i.e., "we need div to display the results in")**
1) **Once we know _why_ we need each element, think about how to implement the "Why" as a "How" (i.e., `resultsEl.textContent = newResults`)**
1) **Find all the 'events' (user clicks, form submit, on load etc) in your app. Ask one by one, "What happens when" for each of these events. Does any state change? Does any DOM update?**
1) **Think about how to validate each of your features according to a Definition of Done. (Hint: console.log usually helps here.)**
1) **Consider what features _depend_ on what other features. Use this dependency logic to figure out what order to complete tasks.**

Additional considerations:

- Ask: which of your HTML elements need to be hard coded, and which need to be dynamically generated?
- Consider your data model.
  - What kinds of objects (i.e., Dogs, Friends, Todos, etc) will you need?
  - What are the key/value pairs?
  - What arrays might you need?
  - What needs to live in a persistence layer?
- Is there some state we need to initialize?
- Ask: should any of this work be abstracted into functions? (i.e., is the work complicated? can it be reused?)

# Plan

## Order

1. hard code html for sign in/up and polls pages
2. style hard coded html
3. sign in page set up
    1. form event listeners
    2. supabase fetch function
        - sign in function
        - sing up function
        - redirect function
        - authenticate/user function
4. polls page set up
    1. form event listener
        - updates current poll state (questions & options)
    2. render poll function
    3. display poll function
        - clears current poll container
        - calls render poll function
        - appends to current poll container
    4. vote increment/decrement event listeners
        - updates current poll state (votes)
        - calls display poll function
    5. supabase fetch functions
        - create a poll function
            - inserts current poll state to a row in supabase
        - get polls function
            - fetches all rows of poll data from supabase
        - logout function
    6. display past polls function
        - clears past poll container
        - gets past poll data via getPolls function
        - loop through array of past poll data
            - calls render poll for each object of data
            - appends to past poll container
    7. on load event listener
        - calls display past polls function
    8. publish poll event listener
        - calls create a poll function
        - clears current poll container
        - resets state
        - calls display past polls function
    9. logout event listener
        - calls supabase logout function (redirects user to sign in/up page)
5. stretch goals / styling
